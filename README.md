(Unity Project) A side project in unity, mimicking the old eye of the beholder games!

Just something I'm wokring on the side while I work on my roguelike. Wanted to make something a in bit more of a `Unity` style, since my other current unity project is significantly more code-heavy and has minimal inspector usage.
